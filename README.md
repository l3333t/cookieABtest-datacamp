DataCamp project - A/B Test Analysis of mobile game Cookie Cats

The data showed that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than at level 40.

Hedonic adaptation hypothesis: if players play without interruption, their interest decreases. A gate at level 30 helps to avoid rapid fading of interest.

Conclusion: moving the gate to level 40 is not worth it, as this will lead to lower user retention.
